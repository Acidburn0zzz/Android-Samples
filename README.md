## Governence

The code for each of the Samples is managed by the author of the Sample.  When a pull request comes in for a specific Sample the Author(s) should be notified by the pull request owner to perform a code review.  When the author
indicates that the pull request is ready to be merged (via a comment on the pull request) they can then send a message to a committer through github messages to have the changes merged.

If there are more than one Author for a specific Sample, only one Author is required to indicate that the pull request is ready.  If there's more than one Sample affected by a pull request, at least one Author from each Sample must code review
the pull request and indicate that it is ready to be merged before the pull request can be merged.

If the Author of the pull request is the actual owner of the Sample, then the Author should send a message to a committer to have their changes merged.

**Ownership Transfer:**
An Author can transfer ownership to another Author by opening up an [Issue](https://github.com/blackberry/BB10-WebWorks-Samples/issues) where both the original Author requests ownership to be transfered to the new Author, and the new Author agrees to take ownership of the code.  
The README for the Sample should be updated to indicate the new Author.

## Bug Reporting and Feature Requests

If you find a bug in a Sample, or have an enhancement request, simply file an [Issue](https://github.com/blackberry/BB10-WebWorks-Samples/issues) for the Sample.
